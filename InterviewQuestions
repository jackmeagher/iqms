JOB: Front-End Application Developer
DESCRIPTION:
  Responsibilities include translation of UI/UX design wireframes to actual code that 
  will produce visual elements of the application. You will work with the UI/UX designer and bridge the 
  gap between graphical design and technical implementation, taking an active role on both sides and 
  defining how the application looks as well as how it works.
  
EXAMPLE QUESTIONS:
  QUESTION 1 (Easy):
    Have you worked with javascript libraries? 
    FOLLOW-UP: Which, and why those over others?
    FAVORABLE RESPONSES: Bootstrap, Angular, Ember, React, Backbone, JQuery
    
  QUESTION 2 (Easy):
    Explain the difference between the JavaScript call and apply functions.
    ANSWER: 
      Apply lets you invoke the function with arguments as an array. 
      Call requires the parameters be listed explicitly.
      
  QUESTION 3 (Easy):
    Define the term 'closure' and give an example of it in JavaScript.
    ANSWER: 
      A closure is the local variables for a function - kept alive after the function has returned.
      OR
      A closure is a stack-frame which is not deallocated when the function returns 
      (as if a 'stack-frame' were malloc'ed instead of being on the stack).
      
  QUESTION 4 (Easy-Intermediate):
    Identify two ways in which you can clear a floated element with HTML/CSS.
    ANSWER:
      Method 1: Use a "clearer" div
      Method 2: Alsett Clearing Method (better bc adds nothing to HTML)
      
  QUESTION 5 (Intermediate):
    What is the difference between event bubbling and event capture?
    ANSWER:
      Event bubbling and capturing are two ways of event propagation in the HTML DOM API, when an event occurs in an 
      element inside another element, and both elements have registered a handle for that event. 
      The event propagation mode determines in which order the elements receive the event.
      With bubbling, the event is first captured and handled by the innermost element and then propagated to outer elements.
      With capturing, the event is first captured by the outermost element and propagated to the inner elements.

  QUESTION 1 (Easy): 
    Talk about the 3 worse defects of your preferred language.
    
  QUESTION 2 (Easy):
    Why are first-party cookies and third-party cookies treated so differently?
    ANSWER: 
      A third-party cookie is a cookie set by (and on) a domain name that is not the domain name that appears in the browser 
      address bar. It might be set as part of a side resource load(image, JS, iframe, etc. from a different hostname) 
      or an AJAX HTTP request to a third-party server.
      A first-party cookie, on the other hand, is a cookie set by the domain name that appears in the browser address bar.
      
  QUESTION 3 (Intermediate):
    How would you manage the migration of a project from MySQL to PostgreSQL?
    ANSWER: 
      The easiest method would be to use the open-source project 'mysql2postgres'. It simply requires that one have Ruby
      installed. However, there are many other methods that are perfectly acceptable.
      
  QUESTION 4 (Easy-Intermediate):
    How would you backup and restore data using mysqldump from the command line?
    ANSWER:
      BACKUP:
        $ mysqldump --opt -u [uname] -p[pass] [dbname] > [backupfile.sql]
        [uname] Your database username
        [pass] The password for your database (note there is no space between -p and the password)
        [dbname] The name of your database
        [backupfile.sql] The filename for your database backup
        [--opt] The mysqldump option
      RESTORE:
        Create an appropriately named database on the target machine
        Load the file using the mysql command:
        $ mysql -u [uname] -p[pass] [db_to_restore] < [backupfile.sql]
